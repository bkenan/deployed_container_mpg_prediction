# Car Miles Per Gallon (MPG) prediction

This application uses some car information such as'cylinders','displacement','horsepower','weight','acceleration' and 'year' to predict MPG. I have used AWS ECR to build and push the Docker image to create a container for continuous deployment. This app was later deployed using AWS Application Runner.
